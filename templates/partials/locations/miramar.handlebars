<p>The Miramar Water Treatment Plant began operation in 1962. The plant provides drinking water to an estimated 500,000 customers in the northern section of the City. Located in the Scripps Miramar Ranch community, the treatment plant is adjacent to Miramar Reservoir. Plant capacity is 144 million gallons of treated drinking water per day. The City recently completed a 14-year multi-phase expansion and upgrade plant project to ensure future customer demands and more stringent drinking water standards/regulations were met. Since 2012, the Miramar Water Treatment Plant has participated in the American Water Works Association's Partnership for Safe Water Program, which involved an extensive self assessment and optimization program and report. Based on the plant's staff efforts and its documenting report, the plant was awarded the Partnership's Director's Award in November 2012. In continuing its efforts to achieve a more fully optimized system, the Miramar Water Treatment Plant was subsequently awarded the Partnership's President's Award in June 2013. Currently, there are only five other treatment plants in the United States that have achieved this prestigious award.</p>
