<p>When the Alvarado Water Treatment Plant began operation in 1951, it replaced old water treatment plants at University Heights and Chollas Heights. Located adjacent to Murray Reservoir, Alvarado today provides drinking water to customers in the central section of the City. Plant capacity is 120 million gallons of treated drinking water per day. A multi-phase expansion and upgrade project for the plant was completed in 2011 and included a 1.1 megawatt solar power system. The Alvarado Plant began its first year of active participation in AWWA's Partnership for Safe Water Program in 2013 and has implemented several optimizing projects. Alvarado is also home to the City's Water Quality Laboratory, which continuously monitors the City's drinking water to make sure it is always safe and meets all state and federal health standards.
